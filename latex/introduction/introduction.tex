\chapter{Introduction}

In the following sections, we introduce the key concepts relevant to our research. Since topics such as containerization and container orchestration — and operations in general — are often underrepresented in the academic curriculum, we find it essential to provide the reader with foundational context.

Chapter~\ref{chap:research} forms the core of the theoretical part of our research. It describes the methods employed, the experimental environment we created, and the rationale behind the selection of the tools used.

Chapter~\ref{chap:implementation} focuses on the implementation of the security tool developed as a result of our research. This chapter takes a practical perspective and highlights the most significant engineering aspects of our solution.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:results} summarizes our findings, concludes the research, and reflects on the outcomes achieved through the development of our custom security tool.
