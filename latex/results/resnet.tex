\section{ResNet}

To compare the performance of our model to state-of-the-art models, we have deployed ResNet-18 with following parameters: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item optimizer ADAM with the settings of $beta_1$ = 0.9 and $beta_2$ = 0.99
    \item learning rate of $1e^{-3}$
    \item L2 regularization with $\lambda$ of $1e^{-5}$
\end{itemize}


Training with only synthetic data, the ResNet-18 has achieved an accuracy of 69.33 \% on the testing dataset. Comparing this to our model, we have higher accuracy. However, this could be caused by the fact, that we have spent a lot of time tuning the hyperparameters on our network, but we haven't done the same with the ResNet. 

With incorporated real images into the training dataset, the ResNet has achieved an accuracy of 96 \%. In this case, the ResNet has surpassed our model, which is probably caused by the deeper architecture.
