\subsection{Baseline model}

After generating the first iteration of data, we used it to train multiple models and test the parameters of the network. Based on the best configuration, we established a baseline model with following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{1px}
    \item activation function Leaky RELU with a slope of 0.05 
    \item batch size of 32
    \item optimizer ADAM with betas = 0.9, 0.999
    \item learning rate of $1e^{-3}$ without a scheduler
    \item dropout in fully-connected layer with probability = 0.5
    \item no L2 regularization applied
\end{itemize}

The baseline model is then used on all iterations of data, where we configure the parameters again. This process is documented in the following sections.
