\section{Model selection} \label{sec:modelselection}

First, we train the network only on synthetic data generated by starGen, which has a total of 172 800 images. The network has a large number of hyperparameters, which need to be tuned to recognize objects correctly. In this section, we present the process of selecting the best-performing parameters for the network. During training, the network is validated using both synthetic and real images. The validation set contains 96 000 synthetic and 300 real images. After selecting the configuration of parameters that works best on the validation set, we evaluate the model on testing data, which consists of 300 real images.
