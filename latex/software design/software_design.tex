\chapter{Software design} \label{chap:softwaredesign}

In our work, we are implementing a system that can recognize the following astronomical objects present in the image: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item point source
    \item streak source
    \item streak source that is cut due to being on the edge of the image
    \item elliptical galaxy
    \item cosmic ray
    \item hot pixel
\end{itemize}

As mentioned before, the task of object recognition includes object localization and classification. Because we are using types of astronomical objects, that were not discussed in approaches in \ref{sec:spacerecognition}, we first want to access the possibility of using a neural network to correctly classify our objects into classes. For this reason, we omitted the object localization task. 

The designed network is thoroughly trained on a large amount of synthetic data. Data from real observations are later used to fine-tune the model. The performance of our network is also compared to the state-of-the-art ResNet-18 model.
