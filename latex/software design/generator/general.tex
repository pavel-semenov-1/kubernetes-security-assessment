\subsection{General settings}
General settings include image settings and also parameters of the generation itself. 
The script allows the user to set the number of generated series, the number of frames in the series, and the resolution of the generated image. Lots of parameters are binary indicators, that allow the user to choose whether he wants to save the images, plot the images and save the positions of objects. The user also defines the destination, where files are saved.  In case the positions of objects are read from the TSV file, the user is required to define the path to the file. For this approach to work, the number of frames in one series is not adjustable by the user but is determined by the file.
