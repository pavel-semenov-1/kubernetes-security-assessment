\section{The network}

For the purpose of object recognition, we are deploying a  convolutional neural network, specifically designed for this thesis. During the training process, the network is fed images along with labels of the class. %To achieve a robust and balanced training dataset, we are generating synthetic images using starGen. Real images are later used to fine-tune the model. 
The validation process is used for determining the best-performing parameters of the network. The network is validated using both synthetic and real images.
After establishing the configuration of the model, the system is tested on real data.
