\chapter{Data generation}

In this chapter, we explain how each object in the starGen script is generated. We compare 3D profiles between real and synthetic objects to demonstrate the fidelity of our generator to a real case scenario. We also present examples of each synthetic object and how each parameter affects its appearance. Finally, we explain how synthetic images were generated for the training dataset, and define the parameters used for the generation.
